= Issues

mailto:unicorn-public@bogomips.org is the best place to report bugs,
submit patches and/or obtain support after you have searched the
{email archives}[http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/] and
{documentation}[http://unicorn.bogomips.org/].

* No subscription will ever be required to email the public inbox.
* Cc: all participants in a thread or commit, as subscription is optional
* Do not {top post}[http://catb.org/jargon/html/T/top-post.html] in replies
* Quote as little as possible of the message you're replying to
* Do not send HTML mail, it will likely be flagged as spam

If your issue is of a sensitive nature or you're just shy in public,
then feel free to email us privately at mailto:unicorn@bogomips.org
instead and your issue will be handled discreetly.

If you don't get a response within a few days, we may have forgotten
about it so feel free to ask again.

== Bugs in related projects

unicorn is sometimes affected by bugs in its dependencies.  Bugs
triggered by unicorn in mainline Ruby, rack, GNU C library (glibc),
or the Linux kernel will be reported upstream and fixed.

For bugs in Ruby itself, we may forward bugs to
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ and discuss+fix them on the ruby-core
list at mailto:ruby-core@ruby-lang.org
Subscription to post is required to ruby-core, unfortunately:
mailto:ruby-core-request@ruby-lang.org?subject=subscribe

For uncommon bugs in Rack, we may forward bugs to
mailto:rack-devel@googlegroups.com and discuss there.
Subscription (without any web UI or Google account) is possible via:
mailto:rack-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com
Note: not everyone can use the proprietary bug tracker used by Rack,
but their mailing list remains operational.

Uncommon bugs we encounter in the Linux kernel should be Cc:-ed to the
Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) at mailto:linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
and subsystem maintainers such as mailto:netdev@vger.kernel.org
(for networking issues).  It is expected practice to Cc: anybody
involved with any problematic commits (including those in the
Signed-off-by: and other trailer lines).  No subscription is necessary,
and the our mailing list follows the same conventions as LKML for
interopability.  There is a kernel.org Bugzilla instance, but it is
ignored by most developers.

Likewise for any rare glibc bugs we might encounter, we should Cc:
mailto:libc-alpha@sourceware.org
Keep in mind glibc upstream does use Bugzilla for tracking bugs:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/

== Submitting Patches

See the HACKING document (and additionally, the
{SubmittingPatches}[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches]
document distributed with git) on guidelines for patch submission.

== Contact Info

* public: mailto:unicorn-public@bogomips.org
* private: mailto:unicorn@bogomips.org

We operate a {public-inbox}[http://public-inbox.org/] which
feeds the mailing list.  You may subscribe either using
{ssoma}[http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/] or by sending a mail
to mailto:unicorn-public+subscribe@bogomips.org

ssoma is a mail archiver/fetcher using git.  It operates in a similar
fashion to tools such as slrnpull, fetchmail, or getmail.  ssoma
subscription instructions:

	URL=git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public
	LISTNAME=unicorn

	# to initialize a maildir (this may be a new or existing maildir,
	# ssoma will not touch existing messages)
	# If you prefer mbox, use mbox:/path/to/mbox as the last argument
	# You may also use imap://$MAILSERVER/INBOX for an IMAP account
	# or imaps:// for an IMAPS account, as well.
	ssoma add $LISTNAME $URL maildir:/path/to/maildir

	# read with your favorite MUA (only using mutt as an example)
	mutt -f /path/to/maildir # (or /path/to/mbox)

	# to keep your mbox or maildir up-to-date, periodically run the following:
	ssoma sync $LISTNAME

	# your MUA may modify and delete messages from the maildir or mbox,
	# this does not affect ssoma functionality at all

	# to sync all your ssoma subscriptions
	ssoma sync

	# You may wish to sync in your cronjob
	ssoma sync --cron
