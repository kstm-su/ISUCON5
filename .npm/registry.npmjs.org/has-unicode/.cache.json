For `LC_ALL` and `LANG`, it looks for `.UTF-8` in the value. \nFor `LC_CTYPE` it looks to see if the value is `UTF-8`.  This is sufficient\nfor most POSIX systems.  While locale data can be put in `/etc/locale.conf`\nas well, AFAIK it's always copied into the environment.\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"iarna","email":"me@re-becca.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-12-30T17:33:11.432Z","created":"2014-12-30T17:33:11.432Z","1.0.0":"2014-12-30T17:33:11.432Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/iarna/has-unicode","keywords":["unicode","terminal"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/iarna/has-unicode"},"author":{"name":"Rebecca Turner","email":"me@re-becca.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/iarna/has-unicode/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"6EWGB8L7PCPP2DNV6SVK61ZDE\""}
